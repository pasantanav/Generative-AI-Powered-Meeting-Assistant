Generative AI-Powered Meeting Assistant

App for Summarizing Meetings
Consider you're attending a business meeting where all conversations are being captured by an advanced AI application. 
This application not only transcribes the discussions with high accuracy but also provides a concise summary of the meeting, emphasizing the key points and decisions made.
Tools used in this project:
- OpenAI's Whisper to transform speech to text. 
- IBM Watson's AI to summarize and find key points.
- Make an app with Hugging Face Gradio as the user interface.

In this project, I:
- Create a Python script to generate text using a model from the Hugging Face Hub, identify some key parameters that influence the model's output, and have a basic understanding of how to switch between different LLM models.
- Use OpenAI's Whisper technology to convert lecture recordings into text, accurately.
- Implement IBM Watson's AI to effectively summarize the transcribed lectures and extract key points.
- Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Hugging Face Gradio, ensuring ease of use for students and educators
